subtitle: Hi, I'm Georgina
---

My name is Georgina. I am passionate about caring for and loving all animals, and I started CatPotato.com to pursue that passion. With a lifetime of experience from living with animals and caring for my own cats, I was inspired to mimic that experience for our Cat Potato kitties. We want to lounge with your cat on the couch! We want them to sleep in our bed! We want your kitty to feel like one of the family. We invite you and your pets, young and old, into our home to stay with us as one of our own.

My husband Sam is a remote worker, and he loves having cats around too.
